Each application that uses MySQL should have its own user that only has limited privileges and only has access to the databases it needs to run.
Never use ALL TO .*.
Never use % for a hostname
Application user permissions should be restrictive as possible
Only allow super privileges to dba accounts, and localhost
Never ever give users global privileges, except for root, backup user, monitoring user, replication user
Take extra caution when granting SUPER or FILE privileges: SUPER can modify runtime configuration and become other users, FILE allows reading or writing files as MySQL process		
Create one different user for every application granting only CRUD operations
